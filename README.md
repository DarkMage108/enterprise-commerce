In Enterprise Commerce high-level architecture, Search Engine serves as the primary source for all product data and potentially other types of data in the future. The system is designed to easily integrate AI personalization tools without needing to modify any frontend code. While we are integrated with Shopify by default, we are not tightly bound to it, you can use any commerce platform and adapt data to our format.

## Performance
